## Pytorch-Study
By studying a book named _**'파이토치 첫걸음'**_, I organized what I learned about PyTorch in this repository.  

Ch1,Ch2 don't include codes. So there are no files about this chapters.
</br> The rest of the chapters are implemented in jupyter notebook named chapter name.
</br> Plus, a file named practice is a file practiced based on what I learned from the this book.

### Ch1.What is DeepLearning?
- Concept of DeepLearning.
### Ch2.PyTorch
- install PyTorch.
### Ch3.Linear Regression Analysis -> [code link](https://github.com/ChoiDae1/Pytorch_Study/blob/main/Ch3.ipynb)
- Basic tensor manipulation. (eg. torch.Tensor)
- implement Linear Regrssion using gradient descent. (by using torch.nn, torch.optim.. etc) 
### Ch4.ANN -> [code link](https://github.com/ChoiDae1/Pytorch_Study/blob/main/Ch4.ipynb)
- implement MLP, then solve non-Linear data. (by using nn.Sequential, nn.Linear, nn.ReLU.. etc)
- draw Learning curve through loss data.
### Ch5.CNN -> [code link](https://github.com/ChoiDae1/Pytorch_Study/blob/main/Ch5.ipynb)
- implement CNN ,then classify MNIST images.
- implement famous vision models. (VGGNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet)
### Ch6.RNN -> [code link](https://github.com/ChoiDae1/Pytorch_Study/blob/main/Ch6.ipynb)
- implement Simple RNN, LSTM, then test these model through tinyshakespeare data.
- implement embedding.
### Ch7.Problems and solutions that can arise during learning -> [code link](https://github.com/ChoiDae1/Pytorch_Study/blob/main/Ch7.ipynb)
- Concept of overfitting and underfiting.
- Implement methods to prevent overfittig -> Regularization, Dropout, Data Augmentation, Weight Initialization, 
  Learning rate, normalization, BatchNorm, optimizer
### Ch8.Neural style Transfer -> [code link](https://github.com/ChoiDae1/Pytorch_Study/blob/main/Ch8.ipynb)
- Concept of Transfer Learning and Style Transfer.
- implement the Style Transfer.
### Ch9.Auto Encoder -> [code link](https://github.com/ChoiDae1/Pytorch_Study/blob/main/Ch9.ipynb)
- implement the Auto Encoder.(simple version, convolution version)
- implement UNet for semantic segmentation.
### Ch10.GAN -> [code link](https://github.com/ChoiDae1/Pytorch_Study/blob/main/Ch10.ipynb)
- Concept of GAN.
- implement the basic GAN using MNIST images.
- implement DCGAN using MNIST images.
