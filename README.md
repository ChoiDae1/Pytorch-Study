## Pytorch_Study
By studying a book named _**'파이토치 첫걸음'**_, I organized what I learned about PyTorch in this repertoire.  

Ch1,Ch2 don't include codes. So there are no files about this chapters.
</br> The rest of the chapters are implemented in jupyter notebook named chapter name.
</br> Plus, a file named practice is a file practiced based on what I learned from the this book.

### Ch1.What is DeepLearning?
- Concept of DeepLearning.
### Ch2.PyTorch
- install PyTorch.
### Ch3.Linear Regression Analysis
- Basic tensor manipulation. (eg. torch.Tensor)
- implement Linear Regrssion using gradient descent. (by using torch.nn, torch.optim.. etc) 
### Ch4.ANN
- implement MLP, then solve non-Linear data. (by using nn.Sequential, nn.Linear, nn.ReLU.. etc)
- draw Learning curve through loss data.
### Ch5.CNN
- implement CNN ,then classify MNIST images.
- implement famous vision models. (VGGNet, GoogLeNet, ResNet)
### Ch6.RNN
### Ch7.Problems and solutions that can arise during learning
### Ch8.Neural style Transformer
### Ch9.Auto Encoder
### Ch10.GAN
